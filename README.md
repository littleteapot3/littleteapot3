# Hi, I'm Leah 👋

🎓 Data Scientist passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. I specialize in Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling, primarily working in Python with a focus on Data Visualization—skills I've been building over time and recently strengthened through an intensive BootCamp.

What sets me apart? I combine data science with user research experience to create solutions that are both analytically sound and user-focused. 

## 🚀 What I Bring to the Table
📊 Technical Skills

- Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, and Data Visualization
- Python, SQL, and a multitude of libraries
- A/B testing and experimental design for data-driven decisions

🔍 Research Background

- Need data? Let's brainstorm how best to gather it
- My user research experience helps me ask better questions of data and define features for experimentation
- I enjoy translating complex findings into clear, actionable insights and visuals for stakeholders

🌱 Always Learning

- Currently exploring advanced ML techniques, NLP, and predictive modeling
- Staying current with tools like TensorFlow and emerging data science trends


## 🛠️ Current Projects
**Estimated Delivery Time A/B Test** - A project to analyze whether showing estimated delivery time upfront (during browsing/search) increases order completion rates by reducing uncertainty and setting proper expectations. 

**Crosswalk Access in NY** — A geospatial analysis project to identify pedestrian infrastructure needs in a NY suburb

## 🎯 Seeking Opportunities
I’m currently seeking a role as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Specialist, or Data Analyst, where I can apply my technical and analytical skills to solve challenging problems and deliver actionable results.

## 🌟 Beyond the Code
When I'm not analyzing data, you'll find me:

- 🎮 Playing my annual Stardew Valley marathon (and going all in!)
- 🧩 Competing in puzzle competitions
- 🌄 Hiking, kayaking, and chasing beautiful sunrises
- 📚 Learning something new (currently diving deeper into A/B testing)

## 📬 Let's Connect!
Always excited to connect with fellow data professionals and collaborate on interesting projects!
